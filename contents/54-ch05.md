## Section 4: List Slicing and Copying

Sometimes you don’t need the entire list — just part of it. Python provides a
powerful feature called **slicing** to get sublists, skip values, or even
reverse lists. You’ll also learn the difference between copying and referencing
lists.

---

### Basic Slice Syntax

The general form is:

```python
list[start:end]
```

* `start` is the index where the slice begins (inclusive).
* `end` is the index where it stops (exclusive).

Example:

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(numbers[1:4])  # [1, 2, 3]
```

Here, the slice starts at index `1` and stops before index `4`.

---

### Omitting Start or End

If you leave out the start or end, Python assumes the beginning or end of the
list:

```python
print(numbers[:3])   # [0, 1, 2]
print(numbers[3:])   # [3, 4, 5]
```

---

### Using Step Values

You can also add a step with the syntax:

```python
list[start:end:step]
```

Examples:

```python
print(numbers[::2])   # [0, 2, 4] (every other element)
print(numbers[1::2])  # [1, 3, 5] (every other, starting at index 1)
```

---

### Reversing a List with Slices

A neat trick: use a negative step to reverse a list:

```python
print(numbers[::-1])  # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

---

### Copying vs Referencing

Be careful: if you assign one list to another variable, they both point to the
**same list**:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b[0] = 99

print(a)  # [99, 2, 3]
```

To make a **copy**, use slicing:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a[:]
b[0] = 99

print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # [99, 2, 3]
```

You can also use `.copy()` or `list()` to create a separate copy.

### Why Slicing Matters

Slicing and copying are important for:

* Breaking up data into smaller groups
* Iterating over only part of a list
* Avoiding accidental changes by copying when needed
* Quickly reversing or skipping items

---

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Use slicing to print:

   * The first 3 numbers
   * The last 3 numbers
   * Every other number
   * The list in reverse
