## Section 3: Basic SQL Commands

Now that you understand how databases are structured into tables and records,
it’s time to learn the commands that let you create, add, and view data. These
commands are written in **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, the standard
language for interacting with relational databases.

---

### Creating a Table

To make a new table, you use the `CREATE TABLE` command. You must define each
column’s name and type.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    grade TEXT
);
```

* `id` is the primary key (a unique number for each student)
* `name` is text
* `age` is an integer
* `grade` is text (like "A" or "B")

---

### Inserting Data

To add new records (rows) into a table, use `INSERT INTO`:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES ("Ada", 17, "A");
```

You can insert multiple rows at once:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, grade)
VALUES
("Grace", 16, "B"),
("Linus", 18, "A");
```

---

### Selecting Data

To see what’s in the table, use `SELECT`. The simplest version shows everything:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

* `*` means “all columns”
* This will list every row and column in the table

You can also select specific columns:

```sql
SELECT name, grade FROM students;
```

---

### Deleting Data

To remove rows, use `DELETE`:

```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 2;
```

This removes only the record with `id = 2`.

Without a `WHERE` clause, `DELETE` will remove all rows — use with caution!

---

### Summary

The four essential commands to remember are:

* `CREATE TABLE` — design a new table
* `INSERT INTO` — add new data
* `SELECT` — view data
* `DELETE` — remove data

These are the building blocks for everything else you’ll do with SQL.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a new table called `books` with columns: `id`, `title`, `author`, and
   `year`.
2. Insert three books into the table.
3. Select all the books from the table.
4. Delete one of the books using its `id`.
