## Section 6: Input Validation Patterns

So far, you’ve learned how to use conditionals and loops to make decisions and
repeat code. Now it’s time to combine those tools to solve a common real-world
problem: **input validation**.

Input validation means checking whether the user gave you the kind of data you
actually want — and typically, asking again if they didn’t.

This is critical in real-world programs, especially web applications, where
users might enter anything (by mistake or on purpose because haxorz).

### Why Validate Input?

Without validation, your program might crash or behave incorrectly.

For example:

```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
```

If the user types `"fifteen"` instead of a number, Python will **raise** a
`ValueError` and your program will stop.  We'll talk about **raising an error**
shortly, but it's basically a way for the interpreter to thow a type of
condition that can be caught and dealt with instead of just crashing and
burning.

Back to validation.

You need a way to:

* Check the input
* Give a helpful message if it’s invalid
* Ask again until it’s valid

---

### A Pattern Using `while True`

Here’s a reusable pattern:

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
    if user_input.isdigit():
        number = int(user_input)
        break
    else:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

* This loop keeps running until a valid number is entered.
* `isdigit()` checks if the string is made up only of digits.
* `break` exits the loop once the input is good.

### Adding Conditions to Validation

You can also add rules:

```python
while True:
    age_input = input("Enter your age: ")
    if age_input.isdigit():
        age = int(age_input)
        if 0 < age < 130:
            break
        else:
            print("That age doesn't seem realistic.")
    else:
        print("Please enter a number.")
```

Now you’re checking:

* That the input is a number
* That it’s within a realistic range

---

### Using `try` and `except` for Safer Conversion

Another approach is to use a `try` block:

```python
while True:
    try:
        value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("That’s not a valid number.")
```

This is safer than relying on `isdigit()` when working with negative numbers,
decimals, or more complex validation.

This a part of the try/raise/except triumvirate of errors.  You can `try` a
something in a statement, the interpreter might `raise` an exception if
something goes awry, and then you can explicitly state what to do with an
`except` condition.  We'll talk a lot more about this later.

### Real-World Example: Email Signup

```python
while True:
    email = input("Enter your email: ").strip()
    if "@" in email and "." in email:
        break
    else:
        print("Please enter a valid email address.")
```

This is a simple check — in real web apps, you’d do much more — but it's a good start for beginner-level validation logic.

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a script that:

1. Asks the user to enter a username (must be at least 4 characters)
2. Asks for a password (must be at least 8 characters)
3. Repeats until both inputs are valid
4. Prints a success message once both checks pass

You’ve now learned how to make your Python programs interactive and
resilient using conditionals and loops.

Up next: you’ll dive deeper into **functions** — reusable blocks of code that
make your programs more organized and modular.
