## Section 2: Truthiness and Falsy Values

In Python, not everything that acts like a `True` or `False` value is actually
the boolean `True` or `False`.

Sometimes, Python will treat other values — like strings, numbers, or lists —
*as if* they are either true or false. This is called **truthiness**.

---

### What Is Truthiness?

A value is considered:

* **Truthy** if it behaves like `True` in a condition
* **Falsy** if it behaves like `False` in a condition

This is useful when you want to check if something exists, is empty, or has
content.

---

### Common Falsy Values in Python

The following values are all considered falsy, which means Python treats
them as false when used in an `if` statement:

```python
False       # The boolean value False
None        # Special "no value" object
0           # The number zero
0.0         # Zero as a float
""          # Empty string
[]          # Empty list
{}          # Empty dictionary
```

Everything else is **truthy** — including non-empty strings, non-zero numbers,
and most objects.

---

### Using Truthiness in `if` Statements

Instead of writing:

```python
if len(name) > 0:
    print("You entered a name.")
```

You can write:

```python
if name:
    print("You entered a name.")
```

If `name` is an empty string (`""`), the condition is falsy and won’t run. If
it has text, it’s truthy and the block will run.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Python won’t stop you from writing the longer condition — but using
> truthiness makes your code more readable.

---

### Examples

```python
value = ""

if value:
    print("This is truthy!")
else:
    print("This is falsy.")  # ← this line will run
```

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]

if items:
    print("You have items!")
else:
    print("Your list is empty.")
```

```python
number = 0

if not number:
    print("The number is zero.")
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to enter their nickname
2. If they leave it blank (empty string), print `"You didn't enter anything!"`
3. Otherwise, print `"Welcome, <nickname>!"`

Use truthiness to detect the empty input.

In the next section, you'll learn how to combine multiple conditions using
`and`, `or`, and `not` to build smarter, more flexible logic.
