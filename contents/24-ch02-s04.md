## Section 4: Numbers

Python handles numbers in a way that feels natural, especially if you're coming
from a math mindset or JavaScript. In this section, you’ll learn how to do basic
arithmetic, work with different kinds of numbers, and convert between types.

---

### Number Types in Python

There are two main number types you'll use:

* `int` – Whole numbers (e.g. `-10`, `0`, `99`)
* `float` – Numbers with decimals (e.g. `3.14`, `0.0`, `-5.7`)

Python can work with either type, and it automatically decides based on how you
write the number:

```python
a = 5      # int
b = 3.14   # float
c = 5.0    # float
```

---

### Arithmetic Operations

Python supports standard math operators:

| Operator | Meaning            | Example   | Result |
| -------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition           | `4 + 2`   | `6`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `7 - 3`   | `4`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `5 * 6`   | `30`   |
| `/`      | Division (float)   | `10 / 2`  | `5.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor division     | `10 // 3` | `3`    |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder) | `10 % 3`  | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation     | `2 ** 3`  | `8`    |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Regular division (`/`) always returns a float, even if the result is a whole
> number.

### Operator Precedence

Like in math, some operations happen before others. Python follows this order:

1. `()` — Parentheses
2. `**` — Exponents
3. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` — Multiplication & Division
4. `+`, `-` — Addition & Subtraction

Use parentheses to force a different order:

```python
result_1 = 2 + 3 * 4    # 14
result_2 = (2 + 3) * 4  # 20, not 14
```

---

### Mixing ints and floats

If you mix `int` and `float`, Python will convert to `float`:

```python
a = 5
b = 2.0
print(a / b)  # 2.5
```

---

### Converting Between Strings and Numbers

To use a number in a string or get a number from user input, you’ll need to
convert it:

```python
age = 16
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

```python
num = int("42")      # Converts string to int
pi = float("3.14")   # Converts string to float
```

Trying to convert an invalid string will cause an error:

```python
x = int("hello")  # ValueError!
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> When using `input()`, Python always gives you a string — you must convert it
> to a number if you want to do math.

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for their birth year using `input()`
2. Converts the input into an integer
3. Calculates their age assuming the current year is 2025
4. Prints a message like:

```
You are 17 years old.
```

In the next section, you’ll explore **booleans**, comparison operators, and how
Python makes decisions based on logic.
