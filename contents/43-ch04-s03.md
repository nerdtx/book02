## Section 3: Lists

Lists are one of the most important data structures in Python. They let you
group related data together — names, numbers, tasks, responses, anything — and
work with them as a single unit.

Think of a list like a row of labeled boxes. Each item has a position, and you
can add, remove, or change items easily.

---

### Creating a List

Use square brackets to create a list:

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
empty_list = []
```

Lists can hold any type of value — even a mix:

```python
mixed = ["Ada", 42, True]
```

---

### Accessing Items by Index

Each item in a list has an **index** (its position), starting at **0**:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(fruits[2])  # cherry
```

If you use an index that’s too high, you’ll get an `IndexError`.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `len(list)` to find how many items are in a list.

```python
print(len(fruits))  # 3
```

---

### Changing List Items

You can replace an item using its index:

```python
colors[1] = "yellow"
print(colors)  # ["red", "yellow", "blue"]
```

---

### Adding and Removing Items

Python has built-in methods to update your list:

```python
animals = ["cat", "dog"]

animals.append("rabbit")     # Adds to the end
animals.insert(1, "hamster") # Adds at index 1
print(animals)  # ['cat', 'hamster', 'dog', 'rabbit']

animals.remove("dog")        # Removes by value
removed = animals.pop()      # Removes last item
print(removed)               # rabbit
```

---

### Looping Through Lists

The `for` loop is perfect for lists:

```python
tasks = ["email", "call", "report"]

for task in tasks:
    print("Do:", task)
```

---

### Checking for Items

You can use `in` to check whether an item is in the list:

```python
if "banana" in fruits:
    print("We have bananas!")
```

---

### Sorting and Slicing Lists

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
print(letters[1:4])  # ['b', 'c', 'd']
```

* `.sort()` changes the list in-place
* Slicing lets you extract parts of a list: `[start:stop]`, creating a new list
  from the sliced items

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a script that:

1. Creates a list of your 5 favorite movies
2. Prints the first and last movie
3. Adds a new movie to the list
4. Sorts the list and prints the updated version

---

### List Super Powers

Here's a few things to try with indexes and slices, if you dare...

```python
mystuff = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

- What happens if you use a negative index? `mystuff[-1]`
- What happens if you don't give an end to a slice? `mystuff[2:]`
- What happens if you don't give a start to a slice? `mystuff[:2]`
- What happens if you give a 3rd value to a slice? `mystuff[0:5:2]`
- What happens if you just give a 3rd value to a slice? `mystuff[::2]`
- What happens with a negative slice starting? `mystuff[-3:]`

Next, you’ll learn how to organize related information using dictionaries,
another powerful structure used throughout Python web apps.
