# Chapter 1: A Quick Start

## Section 1: The Python REPL (Interactive Mode)

Before you start writing Python programs in files, it’s helpful to experiment
with Python in real time. That’s where the **REPL** comes in.

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It’s an interactive Python shell where
you can type code one line at a time and see the result immediately.

---

### What Does REPL Mean?

* **Read**: Python reads your input
* **Eval**: It evaluates (runs) the code
* **Print**: It displays the result
* **Loop**: It goes back and waits for more input

This makes the REPL great for:

* Testing short bits of code
* Checking syntax
* Doing quick math
* Exploring how a function or operator works

---

### How to Start the REPL

To enter Python’s REPL from the terminal:

On Mac/Linux:

```bash
$ python3
```

On Windows (or some systems):

```bash
> python
```

You should see something like:

```
Python 3.x.x (default, ...)
>>>
```

The `>>>` prompt means you’re inside the REPL and ready to start typing Python
code.

---

### Trying It Out

Here are some things you can type and see instant feedback:

```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

>>> 3 + 4
7

>>> "hi".upper()
'HI'
```

The REPL immediately evaluates each line and shows the result.

---

### Multiline Blocks

If you want to enter a block of code like a function or an `if` statement, just
hit **Enter** after each indented line. Python will keep waiting until the block
is complete:

```python
>>> def greet(name):
...     print("Hello,", name)
...
>>> greet("Ada")
Hello, Ada
```

The `...` prompt shows that Python is waiting for more lines to complete the
block.

---

### Exiting the REPL

To exit, use one of the following:

* `exit()`
* `quit()`
* `Ctrl+D` (on Mac/Linux)
* `Ctrl+Z`, then `Enter` (on Windows)

You’ll return to your normal terminal prompt.

---

### When to Use the REPL

Use the REPL when you:

* Want to test a single line or two of code
* Are trying to understand a new function or operator
* Need to check math or syntax quickly
* Want to explore how Python behaves before writing a script

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The REPL is your scratchpad. It’s not meant for full programs, but it’s a
> great place to think and experiment with Python ideas.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to write full Python programs in `.py`
files and run them directly from the command line.
