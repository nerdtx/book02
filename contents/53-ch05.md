## Section 3: Iterating Over Lists

Once you’ve built a list, you often need to *do something with every item*.
Instead of writing out each index one by one, Python makes it easy to loop
through a list.

---

### Looping with `for`

The most common way to work with all items in a list is with a `for` loop:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)
```

Output:

```
I like apple
I like banana
I like cherry
```

The loop body runs once for each item in the list, assigning it to the loop
variable (`fruit` in this case).

---

### Getting Index and Value with `enumerate()`

Sometimes you need both the item *and* its position in the list. That’s where
`enumerate()` comes in:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

Output:

```
0 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `enumerate()` starts counting at 0 by default, but you can change it with
> `enumerate(fruits, start=1)`.

---

### Using `len()` and Indexes

Another way is to loop over indexes with `range()` and `len()`:

```python
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(i, fruits[i])
```

This works, but `enumerate()` is usually clearer and more “Pythonic.”

---

### Filtering During a Loop

You can use `if` statements inside a loop to filter items:

```python
numbers = [3, 7, 10, 15, 20]

for n in numbers:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print(n, "is even")
```

Output:

```
10 is even
20 is even
```

---

### Accumulating Values

Loops are often used to add up or count values:

```python
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92]

total = 0
for score in scores:
    total += score

print("Average:", total / len(scores))
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a script called `grades.py` that:

1. Stores a list of test scores
2. Loops through the scores and prints each one
3. Calculates the average score
4. Prints `"Passing"` if the average is 70 or higher, otherwise `"Failing"`
