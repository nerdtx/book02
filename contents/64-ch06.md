## Section 4: Nesting Lists and Dictionaries

So far, you’ve worked with lists, tuples, and dictionaries separately. In
real-world programs, these structures are often **combined** to represent more
complex data. This is called **nesting** — putting one data structure inside
another.

---

### Lists of Dictionaries

One common pattern is keeping multiple records in a **list of dictionaries**:

```python
students = [
    {"name": "Ada", "age": 17, "grade": "A"},
    {"name": "Grace", "age": 16, "grade": "B"},
    {"name": "Linus", "age": 18, "grade": "A"}
]
```

Each dictionary represents one student, and the list holds them all.

Accessing nested data looks like this:

```python
print(students[1]["name"])  # Grace
```

---

### Dictionaries with Lists as Values

Sometimes a dictionary needs to hold **multiple values for one key**. Lists are
perfect for that:

```python
grades = {
    "Ada": [95, 87, 92],
    "Grace": [88, 90],
    "Linus": [100, 98, 99]
}

print(grades["Ada"])     # [95, 87, 92]
print(grades["Linus"][1])  # 98
```

### Dictionaries Inside Dictionaries

Dictionaries can also contain other dictionaries, allowing for **layered
information**:

```python
users = {
    "ada123": {"name": "Ada", "email": "ada@example.com"},
    "graceB": {"name": "Grace", "email": "grace@example.com"}
}

print(users["ada123"]["email"])  # ada@example.com
```

This structure is useful for modeling users, accounts, or settings.

### Why Nesting Matters

Nesting makes your data **structured** and **organized**:

* A database table row can become a dictionary.
* An entire table can be represented as a list of dictionaries.
* JSON data from an API often uses this exact structure.

By combining lists and dictionaries, you can model almost any kind of data.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary stores a city’s name and
   population.
2. Print the population of the second city in the list.
3. Create a dictionary where the keys are subjects (`"math"`, `"science"`,
   `"history"`) and the values are lists of student names taking those classes.
4. Print one student’s name from the `"science"` list.
