# Chapter 2: Python Syntax and Data Types

## Section 1: Hello, Python

In this chapter, you'll actually begin to write Python code and start learning
the building blocks of the language that will eventually enable you to write
much more advanced software.

Remember our simple program from Chapter 1?

```bash
$ python3 hello.py
Hello from a Python file!
```

This was actually doing a good bit more than you realized.

### Your First Python Statement: `print()`

The word `print()` here is a statement. It's a simple phrase that tells Python
to make a **function call**.  This one statement is tied to thousands of lines
of logic behind that little phrase `print()`.

In short though, the `print()` function displays a message in the terminal or
console.

```python
print("Welcome to Python coding!")
```

You’ll use `print()` often to check what your program is doing — especially when
**debugging** (which literally means getting rid of bugs in your code).  A
**bug** is something happening in your code that you don't want to happen. This
goes back to a time when computers would fill one or more rooms and sometimes
bugs would get in and crawl across a live wire and burn up, creating an error...
a bug.

### Comments in Python

Comments help you explain what your code is doing. They start with a `#` and are
ignored by the computer for the rest of the line.

```python
# This is a comment
print("This will run")  # This is an inline comment
```

Use comments to explain logic or leave notes to yourself.

### Indentation and Whitespace

Python uses **indentation** (spaces) to define blocks of code. Unlike JavaScript
or HTML, you *must* indent properly in Python, or your code will fail.

This is valid:

```python
if True:
    print("Indented correctly!")
```

This is **not**:

```python
if True:
print("This will cause an error")  # ← No indentation!
```

The Python Software Foundation recommends using **4 spaces** for indentation
(not tabs).

> **nerd lore**
> The great argument between tabs and spaces in source code goes back decades.
> Since I'm writing the textbook, I get to decide. Spaces are better than tabs.
> Tabs are for chumps. Don't use tabs.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to store values in variables and use them
to make your programs more dynamic.
