## Section 6: Debugging and Error Messages

Even the best programmers make mistakes — the key is learning how to **debug**.
Debugging means identifying and fixing problems in your code. Python will often
help you by showing an error message called a **traceback** when something goes
wrong.  A traceback is a step by step tracking of the steps of execution taken
by the program.

In this section, you’ll learn how to understand Python’s most common errors and
how to fix them.

### What Is a Traceback?

A traceback appears when Python hits a problem. It tells you:

* What kind of error happened
* Where it happened (line number)
* A short description of the problem

Example:

```python
print(name)
```

If `name` hasn’t been defined yet, you’ll get this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-2>", line 1, in <module>
    print(name)
          ^^^^
NameError: name 'name' is not defined
```

If you have multiple steps that led to the error, you'll see a much longer
traceback.

### Common Python Errors

Here are some of the most common errors beginner programmers see:

| Error Type         | Cause                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NameError`        | You tried to use a variable that hasn’t been defined             |
| `TypeError`        | You used a value in a way that doesn’t match its type            |
| `ValueError`       | You gave a value that’s the wrong format (e.g., `int("cat")`)    |
| `SyntaxError`      | You typed something that Python can't parse (like a missing `:`) |
| `IndentationError` | Your code isn’t indented properly                                |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Python will stop running the moment it hits an error. Fix that line first,
> then run the program again.

### Using `print()` to Debug

One of the most powerful debugging tools is simply using `print()` to see what
your program is doing.

```python
name = input("What’s your name? ")
print("You typed:", name)
```

If your program isn’t behaving the way you expect, try printing:

* Variable values
* Branches of logic
* Step-by-step outputs

This is called **print-based debugging**, and it's useful even for advanced
developers.

### Reading Error Messages Without Panic

When an error appears:

1. **Read the last line of the traceback** — that's the actual error message.
2. **Look at the line number** — it tells you where the error occurred.
3. **Check for typos, missing punctuation, or incorrect types.**
4. **Fix the issue and run your code again.**

Debugging is normal and expected — it’s how we learn.

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user for two numbers
2. Adds them together and prints the result

Then:

* **Intentionally break the code** by changing a variable name or removing a
  closing parenthesis
* Observe the error message
* Fix the error and re-run your script

Now that you know how to read Python’s error messages and fix common problems,
you’re ready to build longer and more complex programs. In the next chapter,
you’ll learn how to control the flow of your programs with conditionals and
loops.
