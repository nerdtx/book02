## Section 5: Real-World Uses

By now, you've learned how to create and manipulate dictionaries, loop through
them, and nest them with other data structures. This final section ties those
skills to the real-world problems you’ll encounter when building web apps, APIs,
and working with databases.

### Dictionaries as JSON Objects

The **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) format is the most common way data is
exchanged between a web browser and a server. In Python, JSON maps directly to
dictionaries.

Here’s a sample JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "Ada",
  "email": "ada@example.com",
  "enrolled": true
}
```

In Python, you’d store that exact structure like this:

```python
user = {
    "name": "Ada",
    "email": "ada@example.com",
    "enrolled": True
}
```

You can convert between Python dictionaries and JSON strings using the `json`
module:

```python
import json

json_string = json.dumps(user)
python_dict = json.loads(json_string)
```

This is essential when sending or receiving data through a web API.

### Data from Web Forms

When you submit a form on a website, that data often gets turned into a
dictionary before your code processes it.

Example:

```python
form_data = {
    "username": "ada123",
    "password": "supersecure",
    "newsletter": "yes"
}
```

You might check and respond to this data just like any other dictionary.

---

### Dictionaries from Databases

When you query a SQL database, the result is often returned as a dictionary
where:

* **keys** are column names
* **values** are the actual data in each row

Example:

```python
record = {
    "id": 42,
    "name": "Grace Hopper",
    "email": "grace@navy.mil"
}
```

This makes dictionaries an ideal preparation for working with SQL in the next
chapters.

### Configuration and Settings

Many applications store configuration or settings in dictionaries:

```python
settings = {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": True,
    "volume": 80
}
```

You can update these values dynamically in your code, making it easy to build
user preferences or toggle features.

---

### Summary

Dictionaries let you:

* Structure complex, meaningful data
* Map real-world things like people, items, or settings
* Work with APIs, JSON, forms, and databases
* Combine clean structure with flexible code

This is why dictionaries are one of the most important tools in any Python
programmer’s toolbox.

### Practice Challenge

1. Simulate receiving a JSON object from a user signup form. Create a dictionary
   with `"username"`, `"email"`, `"subscribe"` keys.
2. Convert it to a JSON string and print it.
3. Add logic to print a message like `"Welcome, Ada!"` only if `"subscribe"` is
   `"yes"`.
