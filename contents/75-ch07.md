## Section 5: Updating Records

Databases aren’t static — the information they hold changes over time. Students
graduate, prices change, settings get updated. SQL provides the `UPDATE` command
to make changes to existing records.

---

### Updating a Single Record

The basic format looks like this:

```sql
UPDATE students
SET grade = "B"
WHERE id = 1;
```

This changes the `grade` for the student with `id = 1`.

Without the `WHERE` clause, *every row* in the table would be updated —
something you usually don’t want!

---

### Updating Multiple Records

You can update multiple rows at once if they meet the condition:

```sql
UPDATE students
SET grade = "C"
WHERE age < 17;
```

This changes the grade for all students younger than 17.

---

### Updating Multiple Columns

You can also update more than one column in a single command:

```sql
UPDATE students
SET age = 18, grade = "A"
WHERE name = "Grace";
```

This sets Grace’s age and grade at the same time.

---

### Safe Updates

Always remember:

* Use `WHERE` to target specific rows.
* Double-check the condition before running the query.
* Test with a `SELECT` first to confirm which rows will change.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade = "C";
```

Once you’re sure, then apply the `UPDATE`.

### Why Updates Matter

`UPDATE` lets you keep your data accurate:

* Correct mistakes (typos in names, wrong ages)
* Reflect real-world changes (new grades, updated phone numbers)
* Keep your database useful and up to date

---

### Practice Challenge

1. Update a student’s grade in your `students` table.
2. Update the ages of all students older than 17, increasing each by 1.
3. Update both the name and grade of a student in one command.
4. Try selecting the affected rows before and after each update to confirm your
   changes worked.
