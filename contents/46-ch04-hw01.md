## Homework Assignment: Build a Command-Line Quiz Game

### Objective:

Apply your knowledge of conditionals and loops to create an interactive
multiple-choice quiz that checks answers, tracks score, and gives feedback.

---

### Instructions:

Create a Python script named `quiz_game.py` that meets the following requirements:

### Part 1: Quiz Logic

1. Write a list of 3–5 multiple-choice questions, each with:

   * A question string
   * 3 or 4 answer options
   * The correct answer

Example:

```python
question_1 = {
    "text": "What does CPU stand for?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Central Process Unit",
        "B": "Central Processing Unit",
        "C": "Computer Personal Unit"
        },
    "answer": "B"
}


questions = [ question_1, question_2 ]
```

2. Loop through the questions and:

   * Print the question and options
   * Ask the user to type `A`, `B`, `C`, etc.
   * Validate the input
   * Check if the answer is correct
   * Keep track of the number of correct answers

---

### Part 2: Input Validation

* Use a `while` loop to ensure the user types a valid answer (only `A`, `B`,
  `C`, etc.)
* Use `.strip().upper()` to sanitize input

---

### Part 3: Final Score

* After the quiz ends, print the user’s final score as:

  ```
  You got 3 out of 5 correct.
  ```

* Use an `if` statement to give a final message:

  * 100%: `"Perfect score! Great job!"`
  * 60–99%: `"Nice work! Keep practicing."`
  * Below 60%: `"Keep trying — you’ll get there!"`

---

### Bonus Challenge (Optional):

* Add a retry loop that asks: `"Would you like to play again? (yes/no)"`
* Use a `while True` loop and `break` when the user says `"no"`

---

### What to Submit:

* Your `quiz_game.py` file
* A screenshot of your quiz results in the terminal
