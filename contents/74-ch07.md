## Section 4: Filtering and Sorting Data

So far, you’ve learned how to create tables, insert records, and view everything
with `SELECT`. But real databases often have *too much data* to look at all at
once. That’s why SQL gives you tools to *filter and sort* results, showing
exactly what you need.

---

### Filtering with `WHERE`

The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on a condition:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade = "A";
```

This returns only the students with an `"A"` grade.

The formal term for the filter portion of an sql query is called a
**predicate**.  The predicate says *which records to return*.

---

### Comparison Operators

You can filter using comparison operators:

* `=` equal to
* `!=` not equal to
* `<` less than
* `>` greater than
* `<=` less than or equal
* `>=` greater than or equal

Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students
WHERE age > 16;
```

This shows only students older than 16.

---

### Combining Conditions with `AND` / `OR`

You can chain conditions together:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade = "A" AND age > 16;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE grade = "B" OR grade = "C";
```

---

### Sorting with `ORDER BY`

To control the order of results, use `ORDER BY`:

```sql
SELECT name, grade FROM students
ORDER BY grade;
```

This sorts alphabetically by grade.

You can also sort in descending order:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

---

### Limiting Results

If you only want the first few results, use `LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
LIMIT 2;
```

This shows just the first 2 rows.

---

### Why Filtering and Sorting Matter

These tools let you:

* Find specific information quickly
* Analyze subsets of data (like all students over 16)
* Produce reports in a clear order

They transform a huge dataset into something useful and readable.

### Practice Challenge

1. Select all students with a grade of `"A"`.
2. Select all students older than 16.
3. Select all students who are either 16 years old **or** have a grade of `"B"`.
4. Select all students and sort them by age in descending order.
5. Select only the first 2 students in the table.
