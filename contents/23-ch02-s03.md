## Section 3: Strings

A **string** is a sequence of characters — letters, numbers, spaces, and
symbols — that are all saved together.  These are created by enclosing the
characters in quotes. In Python, strings are used to store names,
messages, passwords, and anything else made of text.

You've already used strings when writing `print("Hello, world!")`.  The string
in that statement was `"Hello world!"`. Technically the string part was `Hello
world!` (notice the quotes are not a part of the string value).  Now you'll
learn how to create, combine, and modify them.

---

### Creating Strings

You can define strings using either single or double quotes:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = 'Ada'
```

Python treats both the same, so choose the one that makes your code easier to
read.

You can also create multi-line strings using triple quotes:

```python
poem = """Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Python is fun,
And so are you."""
```

This is super useful for a number of reasons we'll dive into later.

---

### String Concatenation

You can **combine** (concatenate) strings using the `+` operator:

```python
first = "Alan"
last = "Turing"
full = first + " " + last
print(full)  # Alan Turing
```

There's also a bit of a hack that allows you to use `*` to repeat a string:

```python
echo = "Hi! " * 3
print(echo)  # Hi! Hi! Hi!
```

---

### String Escape Characters

If you need to include quotes or special characters inside a string, use
**escape sequences**, which is a way of writing special characters:

```python
quote = "He said, \"Hello there!\""
newline = "Line 1\nLine 2"
tabbed = "Item\tPrice"
```

| Escape Code | Meaning      |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `\"`        | Double quote |
| `\'`        | Single quote |
| `\n`        | New line     |
| `\t`        | Tab space    |


The **interpreter**, or the software that turns your python code into actual
runnable software, knows these and many other escape sequences.

### Common String Methods

Python has many helpful string methods that let you manipulate text:

```python
text = "  Hello, Python!  "
print(text.lower())     # "  hello, python!  "
print(text.strip())     # "Hello, Python!"
print(text.replace("Python", "World"))  # "  Hello, World!  "
```

| Method           | Description                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `.lower()`       | Converts to lowercase                  |
| `.upper()`       | Converts to uppercase                  |
| `.strip()`       | Removes leading/trailing spaces        |
| `.replace("a", "b")` | Replaces `a` with `b`                  |
| `.startswith("aaa")`  | Checks if string starts with `aaa` |
| `.endswith("yyy")`    | Checks if string ends with `yyy`   |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> String methods don’t change the original string — they return a **new**
> string. Strings in Python are **immutable**, which means they can't be
> changed, so instead you create new buckets of data that get attached to the
> same label.

---

### Type Conversion

To combine numbers and strings, you must convert the number to a string using
`str()`:

```python
age = 16
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

If you try this without `str()`, Python will give you a `TypeError`.

---

### Collecting user input with `input()`

There's a useful function called `input()` that asks the user for a value.

The function is used like `name = input("your name: ")`. This presents the user
a prompt right in the terminal where the python program is running. The user
would type, and the value would be stored in the `name` variable.

```python
first_name = input("first name: ")
last_name = input("last name: ")
```

This shows that you can collect multiple values from your users.

### Practice Challenge

Write a program that:

1. Asks a user for first and last name and store in two variables
2. Joins them together into a full name
3. Prints a welcome message like:

```
Welcome, Grace Hopper!
```

Add a second version that prints the name in all uppercase.

addition, division, and type conversion between strings and integers.
