## Homework Assignment: Building a Mini Address Book

### **Objective**

Practice creating, updating, and using dictionaries (including nested
structures) to represent and process real-world data.

---

### Part 1: Basic Dictionary Skills

1. Create a dictionary called `book` with keys: `"title"`, `"author"`, and
   `"year"`.
2. Print the dictionary.
3. Update the `"year"` to a new value.
4. Add a `"genre"` key with a value.
5. Delete the `"author"` key.
6. Print the final result.

---

### Part 2: Looping Through a Dictionary

1. Create a dictionary of 3 animals and their average lifespans.
2. Write a loop to print only the animals (keys).
3. Write another loop to print only the lifespans (values).
4. Use `.items()` to print each animal with a sentence like:

   ```
   A dog lives about 13 years.
   ```

---

### Part 3: Nested Data

1. Create a dictionary called `contacts` where:

   * Keys are names (like `"Ada"`, `"Grace"`, `"Linus"`)
   * Values are **another dictionary** with `"phone"` and `"email"`

   Example:

   ```python
   contacts = {
       "Ada": {"phone": "555-1234", "email": "ada@example.com"}
   }
   ```
2. Print just Adaâ€™s email.
3. Add a new contact with both phone and email.
4. Remove one contact entirely.
5. Loop through all contacts and print them neatly.

---

### Part 4: Real-World Example

1. Simulate JSON-like data in Python with this dictionary:

   ```python
   user = {
       "username": "student123",
       "enrolled": True,
       "grades": [88, 92, 79]
   }
   ```
2. Print the username.
3. Print the average grade.
4. If `"enrolled"` is `True`, print `"Welcome back!"`.

---

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)

* Create a program that asks the user to add contacts to a dictionary until they
  type `"done"`.
* Each contact should include `"phone"` and `"email"`.
* Print the final dictionary in a clean format.

---

### Submission Requirements

* A Python file named `chapter6_homework.py`
* Code should include comments explaining each step
