## Section 3: Looping Through Dictionaries

Just like lists, dictionaries often contain multiple items — and you’ll want to
process them one by one. Since dictionaries are built on **key-value pairs**,
you can loop through keys, values, or both at the same time.

---

### Looping Through Keys

By default, a `for` loop goes through the dictionary’s **keys**:

```python
student = {"name": "Ada", "age": 17, "grade": "A"}

for key in student:
    print(key)
```

Output:

```
name
age
grade
```

This is useful when you only care about the labels.

---

### Looping Through Values

If you want the **values** instead of the keys, use `.values()`:

```python
for value in student.values():
    print(value)
```

Output:

```
Ada
17
A
```

---

### Looping Through Both Keys and Values

The most common approach is using `.items()`, which gives you both the key and
value at once:

```python
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

Output:

```
name : Ada
age : 17
grade : A
```

---

### Using `in` With Dictionaries

Remember, the `in` keyword always checks keys — not values:

```python
print("name" in student)   # True
print("Ada" in student)    # False
```

If you want to check for values, use `.values()`:

```python
print("Ada" in student.values())  # True
```

---

### When to Loop Through Keys vs Values vs Items

* Use **keys** when you only care about the labels (e.g., column names).
* Use **values** when you only need the data (e.g., test scores).
* Use **items** when you want both (e.g., printing a formatted record).

### Practice Challenge

Create a dictionary of 3 countries and their capitals.

1. Loop through the dictionary and print only the country names.
2. Loop again and print only the capitals.
3. Finally, loop with `.items()` and print both in the format:

   ```
   The capital of France is Paris.
   ```
