## Section 6: Practical Uses of Lists and Tuples

Now that you’ve learned the basics of lists and tuples, let’s see how they come
together in real-world programming. These data structures show up everywhere in
Python — from simple scripts to full web applications.

---

### Storing Related Values Together

Lists and tuples are perfect for grouping related information:

```python
# name, age, grade
student = ("Ada", 17, "A")
```

Here we’ve grouped a student’s name, age, and grade into one tuple. This is
easier to manage than three separate variables.

You can also keep a list of tuples:

```python
students = [("Ada", 17, "A"), ("Grace", 16, "B"), ("Linus", 18, "A")]
```

Now you have a full class roster.

### Returning Multiple Values

Functions often need to return more than one piece of data. Tuples make this
simple:

```python
def get_stats(numbers):
    return min(numbers), max(numbers), sum(numbers)/len(numbers)

low, high, avg = get_stats([10, 20, 30])
print(low, high, avg)  # 10 30 20.0
```

### Iterating Through Collections of Data

Imagine storing shopping cart items in a list:

```python
cart = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"]

for item in cart:
    print("You bought:", item)
```

Or a list of coordinate pairs for a drawing program:

```python
points = [(0,0), (1,2), (3,4)]

for x, y in points:
    print("Point at:", x, y)
```

### Preparing for Databases and APIs

The skills you’ve learned here connect directly to later chapters:

* **Databases**: Each row in a SQL table can be represented as a tuple or
  dictionary in Python.
* **APIs**: JSON data you’ll send and receive is often structured like nested
  lists and dictionaries.

That’s why lists and tuples are so foundational — they’re the building blocks of
structured data in Python.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a list of 5 `(name, score)` tuples representing students and their test scores.
2. Loop through the list and print each student’s name and score.
3. Write a function that takes the list and returns the highest-scoring student as a tuple.
4. Print the result.
