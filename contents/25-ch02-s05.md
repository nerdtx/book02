## Section 5: Booleans and None

So far, you've worked with strings and numbers — types that store text and
quantities. But what if your program needs to ask a question or make a decision?

That’s where **booleans** come in.

---

### Booleans: True or False

In Python, a **boolean** is a value that is either `True` or `False`.

```python
is_logged_in = True
has_permission = False
```

You’ll use booleans any time you need to:

* Check if something is equal
* Make a decision
* Control program flow with `if` statements (coming in Chapter 3)

### Comparison Operators

You can create boolean values by comparing things:

| Operator | Meaning               | Example  | Result  |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `==`     | Equals                | `3 == 3` | `True`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal             | `5 != 2` | `True`  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `10 > 7` | `True`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `4 < 3`  | `False` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `3 >= 3` | `True`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `2 <= 1` | `False` |

### Short Intro to Comparison Operations

In Python, you use `if something:` to compare and decide whether to act or not.

Some examples:

```python
my_age = 30

if my_age > 25:
    # this one is true
    print("old enough")

if my_age == 25:
    # this one is false
    print("just right")

if my_age <= 30:
    # this one is true
    print("too young for a discount")
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A single `=` is for assignment. A double `==` checks for equality.

---

### The `None` Value

Python has a special value called `None`, which means *no value* or *nothing
here*.

```python
user = None
```

You’ll often see `None` used to:

* Indicate that something hasn’t been set yet
* Represent missing or optional values
* Reset a variable to “empty”

```python
password = None

if password is None:
    print("Please enter a password.")
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `is None` and `is not None` when checking if a variable holds the `None`
> value.  There are certain edge cases involving language esoterica where
> `== None` is a bad idea.

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python script that:

1. Stores a person’s age as a number
2. Checks if the person is old enough to vote (age ≥ 18)
3. Prints `True` or `False`
4. Also print a friendly message like `"You can vote!"` or `"Sorry, you're too
   young."`

Next, you'll learn how to debug your code — what to do when things go wrong and
how to read error messages without panicking.
