## Section 2: Modifying Dictionaries

Dictionaries aren’t just static containers — they’re designed to be updated,
changed, and extended as your program runs. You can add new keys, update values,
and remove entries, making them flexible for storing real-world data.

---

### Adding New Key-Value Pairs

You can add a new key by simply assigning it a value:

```python
student = {"name": "Ada", "age": 17}

student["grade"] = "A"
print(student)
# {'name': 'Ada', 'age': 17, 'grade': 'A'}
```

If the key doesn’t exist yet, Python creates it.

---

### Updating Existing Values

If the key already exists, assigning a new value will update it:

```python
student["age"] = 18
print(student)
# {'name': 'Ada', 'age': 18, 'grade': 'A'}
```

This is handy when data changes (like updating a user’s profile).

---

### Deleting Items

There are a few ways to remove entries from a dictionary:

* **Using `del`**:

```python
del student["grade"]
print(student)  # {'name': 'Ada', 'age': 18}
```

* **Using `.pop()`** (removes the key and gives back its value):

```python
age = student.pop("age")
print(age)      # 18
print(student)  # {'name': 'Ada'}
```

---

### Checking Before Deleting

Trying to delete a key that doesn’t exist will cause an error. Use `in` to check
first:

```python
if "grade" in student:
    del student["grade"]
```

---

### Why Modifying Dictionaries Matters

In real applications, data changes all the time:

* Adding new users or products
* Updating information when it changes
* Removing items that are no longer valid

Dictionaries make these updates fast and easy.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a dictionary named `book` with keys: `"title"`, `"author"`, and `"year"`.
2. Add a new key `"genre"`.
3. Update the `"year"` to a new value.
4. Remove the `"author"` key.
5. Print the final dictionary.
