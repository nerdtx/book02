## Section 5: Tuples

So far, you’ve worked with **lists**, which are flexible because you can add,
remove, and change items. But sometimes you need a collection of values that
**should not change** — like fixed settings, coordinates, or days of the week.
That’s where **tuples** come in.

---

### What Is a Tuple?

A tuple is an **ordered collection** of items, just like a list, but it is
**immutable** — meaning once created, it cannot be modified.

You make a tuple with parentheses `()`:

```python
point = (3, 4)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
mixed = ("Ada", 42, True)
```

---

### Accessing Tuple Items

You can access tuple elements by index, just like lists:

```python
print(point[0])  # 3
print(point[1])  # 4
```

---

### Why Tuples Are Immutable

Because tuples can’t be changed:

* They are safer when you don’t want accidental modifications
* They can be used as dictionary keys (lists cannot)
* They are often faster than lists for fixed data

---

### Tuple Packing and Unpacking

Tuples are often used to group values together, then split them apart:

```python
person = ("Ada", 36)

# Unpacking
name, age = person
print(name)  # Ada
print(age)   # 36
```

This is called **tuple unpacking**.

---

### Returning Multiple Values from Functions

Functions can return multiple values using a tuple:

```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    quotient = dividend // divisor
    remainder = dividend % divisor
    return quotient, remainder

q, r = divide(10, 3)
print(q, r)  # 3 1
```

---

### Single-Item Tuples

Be careful: `(5)` is just the number 5, not a tuple. To make a one-item tuple,
add a trailing comma:

```python
t = (5,)
print(type(t))  # <class 'tuple'>
```

---

### When to Use Tuples vs Lists

* **Use a list** when the data may change (like a shopping list).
* **Use a tuple** when the data should never change (like x,y coordinates).

---

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a tuple called `rgb` with three values: red, green, and blue.
2. Unpack it into three separate variables.
3. Print each variable.
4. Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum of a list as a
   tuple, and test it.
