## Section 2: Tables and Records

Relational databases organize information into **tables**, which structures data
look a lot like spreadsheets. Each table is made up of **rows** (records) and
**columns** (fields), giving structure and consistency to the data.

### Rows (Records)

A **row** represents one complete piece of data — also called a **record**.

For example, in a `students` table, each row might represent one student:

| id | name  | age | grade |
| -- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Ada   | 17  | A     |
| 2  | Grace | 16  | B     |
| 3  | Linus | 18  | A     |

* Row 1 is a record for Ada
* Row 2 is a record for Grace
* Row 3 is a record for Linus

Each row stores all the attributes that belong together for that record.

---

### Columns (Fields)

A **column** represents one category of information, called a **field**.

In the table above:

* `id` is a column that uniquely identifies each student
* `name` is the student’s name
* `age` is the student’s age
* `grade` is the student’s grade

Columns enforce **data consistency**. Every row must follow the same structure —
for example, you can’t put a string in the `age` column if it’s supposed to hold
numbers.

---

### Primary Keys

Every table should have a **primary key** — a unique identifier for each row. In
the `students` table, `id` is the primary key.

* No two students can have the same `id`.
* Primary keys make it possible to find or update a specific record quickly.
* They also allow databases to connect related tables

### Why Tables and Records Matter

Tables provide **structure and reliability**:

* Each row represents one real-world item (student, product, order).
* Each column ensures consistent types of information (all ages are numbers, all
  names are text).
* Primary keys guarantee uniqueness.

This structured design is what makes relational databases powerful — and why
they’ve been the backbone of data storage for decades.

### Practice Challenge

1. Imagine designing a `books` table for a library database. What columns would
   you include? (Think: title, author, year, etc.)
2. Pick a primary key for your `books` table and explain why it makes sense.
3. Write out a small example table with 3 rows of data.
