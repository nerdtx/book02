# Chapter 5: Deeper Dive into Lists

## Section 1: Deeper Dive into Lists

Programs often need to store **many values together** — like a list of names,
scores, or items in a cart. Python’s solution for this is the **list**.

A list is an **ordered collection** of items. Unlike strings, which are
sequences of characters, lists can hold *anything* — numbers, strings, or even
other lists.

### Creating a List

You create a list by putting items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by
commas:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
mixed = ["Ada", 42, True]
```

* `fruits` is a list of strings
* `numbers` is a list of integers
* `mixed` contains a string, a number, and a boolean — lists are flexible!

### Accessing Items by Index

Lists are **indexed**, meaning each item has a number you can use to access it.
Python starts counting at **0**, not 1.

```python
print(fruits[0])  # apple
print(fruits[1])  # banana
print(fruits[2])  # cherry
```

Trying to access an index that doesn’t exist will cause an `IndexError`.

---

### Length of a List

Use the `len()` function to find out how many items are in a list:

```python
print(len(fruits))  # 3
```

This is especially useful when looping over a list.

---

### Lists Are Ordered

Lists keep items in the order you put them in. If you add `"date"` to the end of
the `fruits` list, it stays in that position unless you change it:

```python
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```

---

### Why Lists Are Useful

Lists are great when you need to:

* Keep track of multiple values together
* Loop through a group of items
* Store and update data as a program runs

They’re one of the most powerful and common tools in Python programming.

### Practice Challenge

Create a Python list with the names of three of your friends.

1. Print the list.
2. Print only the first friend’s name using an index.
3. Print how many friends are in the list using `len()`.

Example:

```
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
Alice
3
```
