# Chapter 4: Functions and Data Structures

This chapter introduces the concept of *functions* as a way of organizing and
reusing logic, and covers two critical Python data structures: *lists*
and *dictionaries*. These are used to manage collections of data — like
users, records, or form submissions — in almost every real-world app.

---

## Section 1: Defining and Calling Functions

As your programs grow larger, it becomes harder to manage everything in one
place. That’s where **functions** come in. A function is a reusable block of
code that performs a specific task.

Instead of copying and pasting the same code over and over, you can define a
function once and call it whenever you need it.

---

### What Is a Function?

A function is like a named shortcut — a container for a set of instructions
you want to reuse.

Here’s a simple example:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, user!")
```

* `def` starts the function definition.
* `greet` is the function’s name.
* The indented block is what runs when the function is called.

To **run** the function (execute the instructions inside the function), you call
it by name with parentheses:

```python
greet()  # Output: Hello, user!
```

You can call it as many times as you want.

---

### Why Use Functions?

Functions help you:

* Avoid repeating code
* Make your programs easier to read
* Organize logic into meaningful chunks
* Fix bugs more easily (because you only need to fix one copy)

---

### Functions With Parameters

You can make functions more flexible by giving them **parameters** — values that
you pass in.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
```

Now you can greet different people:

```python
greet("Ada")
greet("Linus")
```

Output:

```
Hello, Ada
Hello, Linus
```

The value you pass in (like `"Ada"`) is called an **argument**.

Functions can have an unlimited numbers of parameters passed to them.

```python
def do_stuff(thing1, thing2, thing3, thing4):
    print(thing1, thing2, thing3, thing4)
```

---

### Returning Values

So far, your functions have just printed things. But they can also **return**
data (provide a value when the function ends):

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # 8
```

* `return` sends a result back to the part of your program that called the
  function.
* You can store the returned value in a variable, use it in calculations, or
  print it.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A function stops running when it hits a `return`. Any code after `return`
> won't run.

---

### Scope: Where Variables Live

Variables defined **inside** a function are only visible **inside** that
function:

```python
def set_secret():
    secret = "shhh"

set_secret()
print(secret)  # Error: name 'secret' is not defined
```

This is called **local scope**. It keeps your functions from accidentally
interfering with each other.

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a function called `introduce()` that:

1. Takes a name and a favorite subject as arguments
2. Returns a string like:
   `"Hi, I'm Linus and I love Computer Science."`
3. Call your function a few times with different names and subjects

---

In the next section, you’ll learn how to write functions with **default
values**, multiple arguments, and how to use them more flexibly with real-world
input.
