## Section 3: Combining Conditions

Real-world decisions are rarely simple. What if you need to check two things at
once? Like whether a user is logged in *and* has admin access? Or whether a form
is blank *or* too short?

Python gives you three powerful tools to combine boolean expressions:

* `and`
* `or`
* `not`

These are called **logical operators**, and they help your code make smarter
decisions.

---

### Using `and`

The `and` operator is used when **both conditions must be true**.

```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You can enter.")
```

This will only print if **both** `age >= 18` **and** `has_id` are true.

---

### Using `or`

The `or` operator is used when **at least one condition can be true**.

```python
has_ticket = False
is_guest = True

if has_ticket or is_guest:
    print("Welcome to the show!")
```

This prints if **either** condition is true (or both).

---

### Using `not`

The `not` operator flips a condition — true becomes false, and false becomes
true.

```python
is_banned = False

if not is_banned:
    print("Access granted.")
```

This will print because `not False` becomes `True`.

---

### Grouping Conditions with Parentheses

Python follows standard order of operations (like in math), but you can use
parentheses to group conditions and make your logic clearer:

```python
if (age >= 18 and has_id) or is_guest:
    print("Access allowed.")
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always use parentheses when combining `and` and `or` together. It avoids
> mistakes and makes your code easier to read.

---

### Example: Form Validation

```python
username = input("Username: ").strip()
password = input("Password: ").strip()

if username and password and len(password) >= 8:
    print("Form is valid.")
else:
    print("Please fill out all fields and use a stronger password.")
```

This checks:

* That both fields are filled in (truthy)
* That the password is at least 8 characters

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user for their age and whether they have a driver's license
2. If the user is **16 or older** and **has a license**, print `"You're good to
   drive!"`
3. If they’re **16 or older** but **don’t have a license**, print `"You need a
   license to drive."`
4. Otherwise, print `"You're too young to drive."`

Use `and`, `not`, and multiple `if` branches to build this logic.

Next, you’ll learn how to make your programs repeat tasks using `while` loops.
