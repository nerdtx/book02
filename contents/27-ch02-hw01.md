## Homework Assignment: Build a Simple User Profile Script

### Objective:

Create a Python script that gathers input from the user, performs calculations,
and prints personalized output using proper syntax, variables, data types, and
logic.

---

### Instructions:

1. Create a new Python file called `user_profile.py`.

2. Your script should:

   * Ask the user for their **first name** and **last name**
   * Ask for their **birth year** (as a number)
   * Calculate the user’s **age** (assume the current year is 2025)
   * Ask whether the user is a student (`yes` or `no`)
   * Store and print a summary of all the information in a friendly message

---

### Requirements:

* Use variables to store each piece of data.
* Use `input()` to get values from the user.
* Use string methods like `.strip()` or `.lower()` as appropriate.
* Convert values to the correct type using `int()` or `str()` where needed.
* Calculate and display whether the user is old enough to vote (18 or older).
* Use at least one boolean variable.
* Include meaningful comments in your code.
* Include at least one intentional print statement used for debugging (e.g.,
  print the raw input).

---

### Sample Output:

```
Welcome, Marie Curie!
You are 28 years old.
Student status: yes
Voting eligibility: True
```

---

### Bonus Challenge (Optional):

* Add logic to format the name as "Last, First" before displaying it.
* If the user enters something invalid (like letters for the birth year)

---

### What to Submit:

* A file named `user_profile.py`
* Screenshots showing your script’s output in the terminal
