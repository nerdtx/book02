## Section 2: Running Python Scripts

While the REPL is great for experimenting with short bits of code, most real
programs are written and saved in **Python script files**. A Python script is
simply a text file with code inside it, ending in `.py`.

In this section, you’ll learn how to create Python files, run them from the
command line, and troubleshoot common issues.

---

### Creating a Python Script

1. Open a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad).
2. Write your Python code in the editor:

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello from a file!")
```

3. Save the file as `hello.py` in a folder you can access easily.

---

### Running the Script

To run your Python file from the command line:

1. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows... From now on terminal means
   Command Prompt).
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing your script.
3. Run the script using the Python command:

```bash
$ python3 hello.py
```

Or, on some systems:

```bash
$ python hello.py
```

You should see:

```
Hello from a file!
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you see an error like `command not found`, make sure Python is installed
> and added to your system’s PATH.  Ask for help if you hit this.

### What Happens When You Run a Script?

* Python reads the entire file from top to bottom.
* Each line is executed in order.
* If there are any syntax errors, Python will stop and print a traceback.

---

### The Role of the Working Directory

Python runs the script *relative to the current working directory* — this
matters if your program tries to open a file or load data.

You can check where you are by typing:

```bash
$ pwd    # Mac/Linux
$ cd     # Windows
```

Make sure you're in the same folder as your `.py` file, or use the full path
when running it.

---

### Tips for Running Scripts Successfully

* Use `.py` as the file extension.
* Never use spaces in filenames (`my_script.py`, not `my script.py`).
* Save your file *before* running it — otherwise, Python runs the old version.
* Start small: print one line, test it, and build up from there.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a file named `greeting.py`.
2. In the file, write code that prints a message of your choice.
3. Run the file from the command line.
4. Modify the message and run it again to see the change.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to make your scripts interactive using
`input()`, so they can ask the user for information while running.
