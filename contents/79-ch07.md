## Homework Assignment: Exploring SQL Basics

### **Objective**

Practice creating, inserting, selecting, filtering, updating, and aggregating
data in SQL. This will give you hands-on experience with projections,
predicates, and summaries.

---

### **Part 1: Creating and Inserting Data**

1. Create a new database called `school.db`.
2. Inside it, create a table called `students` with these columns:

   * `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
   * `name` (TEXT)
   * `age` (INTEGER)
   * `grade` (TEXT)
3. Insert at least **five students** with different ages and grades.

---

### **Part 2: Basic Queries**

1. Select all columns and rows from the table.
2. Select only the `name` and `grade` columns (projection).
3. Select only the students older than 16 (predicate).

---

### **Part 3: Filtering and Sorting**

1. Select all students who have a grade of `"A"`.
2. Select all students who are either 16 years old **or** have a grade of `"B"`.
3. Select all students and sort them by age in descending order.
4. Select only the first 2 students in the sorted list.

---

### **Part 4: Updating and Deleting**

1. Update one studentâ€™s grade to a different value.
2. Update the ages of all students older than 17 by adding 1.
3. Delete a student record using their `id`.

---

### **Part 5: Aggregation and Grouping**

1. Count how many students are in the table.
2. Find the average age of all students.
3. Find the youngest and oldest students using `MIN()` and `MAX()`.
4. Group students by grade and count how many are in each grade.
5. Group only students older than 16 by grade, counting how many are in each
   group (predicate + grouping).

---

### **Bonus Challenge (Optional)**

* Create another table called `courses` with columns: `id`, `course_name`, and
  `instructor`.
* Insert at least 3 courses.
* Think about how you could connect the `students` table with the `courses`
  table in the future using relationships (hint: foreign keys).

---

### **Submission Requirements**

* A `.sql` file with all the SQL statements you wrote, in order.
* Screenshots or console output showing the results of your queries.
