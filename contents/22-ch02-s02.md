## Section 2: Variables and Assignment

In programming, **variables** are names you give to pieces of data. Think of a
variable like a labeled box that stores a value so you can use it later.

Python makes working with variables easy — no need to declare the type up front.
You just choose a name, use `=`, and store a value.

---

### Creating a Variable

```python
greeting = "Hello"
age = 16
pi = 3.14159
```

In each case, Python stores the value on the right (`"Hello"`, `16`, `3.14159`)
in a variable with the name on the left.

> **Hint:**
> The `=` sign in Python means “store this value in this name” — not “is equal
> to,” like in math.  We'll discuss this later, but equality looks for `==`.


### If It Walks Like a Duck

We won't dwell on this concept much, but Python holds to a concept known as
**duck typing**.  The idea is, if the variable can quack, it's a duck.
Confused?

In other languages, you have to tell the runtime environment that you want a
variable to hold a number, or a name, or a reference in memory to a color.  This
is a strongly typed language.

Python takes a different approach. You create a variable and put whatever you
want into that variable.  The type of the variable doesn't matter, as it will
change based on what is assigned to it.

Is this the best way to do it?  There are advantages. There are disadvantages.
This is not an argument that will be addressed here.

### Naming Rules for Variables

Variable names:

* Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
* Can’t have spaces
* Are **case-sensitive** (`score` and `Score` are different)

Valid:

```python
first_name = "Ada"
max_score = 100
is_logged_in = True
```

Invalid:

```python
2cool = "nope"       # Starts with a number
user name = "space"  # Space not allowed
print = "reserved"   # Overwrites a built-in function
```

> **Hint:**
> Avoid using Python keywords (`if`, `for`, `print`, etc.) as variable names.

### Naming Conventions

There are rules in the language around names, but there are also conventions (or
generally accepted ways of doing things) related to naming variables.

This list is not exhaustive, as we haven't discussed many concepts yet.

* Variables should not be camel cased. Don't mix and match cases like
  SomethingYouLike
* `really_long_variable_names_hurt_our_brains` don't do it
* Super ambiguous short variable names get you an `F` in this course


### Changing a Variable’s Value

You can reassign a variable by using `=` again:

```python
color = "blue"
print(color)      # blue

color = "green"
print(color)      # green
```

Python always uses the most recent value you gave a variable.

---

### Variables Can Store Different Types

Python lets you store any kind of value — and even change the type later (though
that’s not always good practice):

```python
x = 42
x = "Now I’m a string"
```

This is called **dynamic typing** — Python figures out the data type automatically.

---

### Using Variables in Other Expressions

You can use variables in math, string operations, and more:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
total = a + b
print(total)  # 15

first = "Ada"
last = "Lovelace"
full_name = first + " " + last
print(full_name)  # Ada Lovelace
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python program that:

1. Stores your name in a variable
2. Stores your favorite number in a second variable
3. Prints a sentence using both values, like:

```
Hi, my name is Inigo and my favorite number is 3.14.
```

In the next section, you’ll learn how to work with strings — one of the most
useful data types in both frontend and backend programming.
