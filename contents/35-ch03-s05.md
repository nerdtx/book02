## Section 5: For Loops and Ranges

While `while` loops are great when you don’t know how many times something
should repeat, `for` loops are perfect when you know exactly how many
times you want to do something — like looping through numbers, menu options,
or characters in a string.

---

### The `for` Loop with `range()`

Python’s `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers, which can be used
with a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `range(n)` starts at 0 and ends at `n - 1`. It creates `n` total values.

---

### `range()` Variations

You can add more arguments to control where the range starts and how much it
increases each time:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```

Examples:

```python
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)  # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)  # 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
```

---

### Loop Variables

The variable you declare in the `for` loop (`i` in most examples) changes value
each time through the loop.

```python
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)
```

Output:

```
P
y
t
h
o
n
```

You can use any name you want for the loop variable:

```python
for student in ["Ada", "Grace", "Linus"]:
    print("Welcome,", student)
```

---

### Nested `for` Loops

You can place one loop inside another to create more complex patterns:

```python
for row in range(3):
    for col in range(4):
        print(f"{row},{col}", end=" ")
    print()
```

Output:

```
0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3
1,0 1,1 1,2 1,3
2,0 2,1 2,2 2,3
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use nested loops with care — they’re powerful, but they can slow things down
> in large programs.

### Practice Challenge

Write a program that:

1. Asks the user how many stars they want in a row
2. Prints that many stars using a `for` loop

Example output:

```
How many stars? 5
*****
```

Bonus: Add a second input for how many **rows** of stars and print a rectangle.

---

Next, you’ll combine everything you’ve learned so far — `if`, `while`, `for`,
and input — to build smart programs that handle bad user input gracefully.
