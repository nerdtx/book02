## Section 3: Using `input()` and Script Interactivity

So far, your scripts have simply printed messages. Now it’s time to make them
interactive.

Python’s `input()` function allows your programs to ask the user for information
and respond accordingly — a key part of writing command-line tools and backend
logic.

---

### The `input()` Function

`input()` displays a message and waits for the user to type something. Whatever
the user types is returned as a **string**.

Example:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

Output:

```
What is your name? Rupert
Hello, Rupert
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The result of `input()` is always a **string**, even if the user types a
> number. You’ll need to convert it manually if needed.

---

### Converting Input to Other Types

Use `int()`, `float()`, or `bool()` to convert the input when appropriate:

```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age)
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1)
```

If the user enters something that isn’t a number, Python will crash with a
`ValueError`. You’ll learn how to handle that later using validation and `try`
blocks.

---

### Multiline Interactions

You can collect multiple values by calling `input()` more than once:

```python
first = input("First name: ")
last = input("Last name: ")
print("Welcome,", first, last)
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a script called `ask.py` that:

1. Asks the user at least 3 questions
2. After each question, the program prints the question and the answer.

Example output:

```
What is your name? Arthur, King of the Britons
Your name: Arthur, King of the Britons
What is your quest? I seek the grail.
Your quest: I seek the grail.
What is your favorite color? Blue, No Green
Your favorite color: Blue, No Green
```

In the next section, you'll learn how to pass data to your script **without
asking** for input — by using **command line arguments**.
