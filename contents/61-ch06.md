# Chapter 6: Dictionaries

## Section 1: Introduction to Dictionaries

So far, you’ve learned about **lists** and **tuples**, which store data in order
and let you access items by their position (index). But what if you want to look
things up by a label instead of a number?

That’s exactly what dictionaries are for. A dictionary stores
**key-value pairs** — just like a real dictionary maps words to definitions.

---

### Creating a Dictionary

You create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` with keys and values separated
by a colon:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Ada",
    "age": 17,
    "grade": "A"
}
```

Here:

* `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"grade"` are the **keys**
* `"Ada"`, `17`, and `"A"` are the **values**

---

### Accessing Values

You get values by using their key inside square brackets:

```python
print(student["name"])   # Ada
print(student["age"])    # 17
```

If you try to access a key that doesn’t exist, Python will raise a `KeyError`.

### Dictionaries vs Lists

Think of the difference this way:

* **Lists**: best when order matters, and you care about the position of items.
* **Dictionaries**: best when you want to look things up by a meaningful label
  (like a username, product ID, or setting).

Example:

```python
# Using a list
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print(colors[0])   # red

# Using a dictionary
color_codes = {"red": "#FF0000", "green": "#00FF00", "blue": "#0000FF"}
print(color_codes["green"])   # #00FF00
```

### Checking if a Key Exists

You can use the `in` keyword to check whether a key is present:

```python
if "grade" in student:
    print("Grade is recorded.")
```

---

### Why Dictionaries Matter

Dictionaries are everywhere in Python programs. They’re perfect for:

* Storing related attributes (like user profiles)
* Acting as lookup tables (like a phone book)
* Representing structured data (like JSON objects from an API)

You’ll use them constantly when working with databases and web applications.

### Practice Challenge

1. Create a dictionary called `car` with keys: `"make"`, `"model"`, and `"year"`.
2. Print the value for the `"model"` key.
3. Add a new key `"color"` with a value.
4. Check whether `"mileage"` exists in the dictionary.
