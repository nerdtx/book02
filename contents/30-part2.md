# Part 2 - Actually writing code a little better

**Computing Pioneer: Guido van Rossum**

> "I would like Python to become the most popular language in the world. I don't
> think it’s unreasonable.”
> Guido van Rossum, creator of Python

In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum began designing Python to be simple,
readable, and powerful. Unlike many languages of the time, Python emphasized
clarity and "getting things done" with minimal code. Today, Python powers web
apps, data science, automation, machine learning, and more — and it's the
language you’ll use to build the backend of your own web applications.

Overview:

This part introduces the foundational building blocks of Python. You'll learn
how Python syntax is structured and how to begin writing short, meaningful
programs.
