# Chapter 3: Python Control Flow

## Section 1: Making Decisions with `if` Statements

Not all programs follow a straight path from top to bottom. Sometimes you want
your code to make decisions — like checking a password, determining if a user is
old enough, or figuring out which path to take in a game. That’s where `if`
statements come in.

In Python, `if` statements let your program ask questions and decide what to do
based on the answer.

---

### Basic `if` Statement

Here’s the simplest kind of decision in Python:

```python
age = 18

if age >= 16:
    print("You can drive!")
```

In this case, Python checks the condition `age >= 16`. If it’s `True`, it runs
the indented line. If it’s `False`, it skips it.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `:` at the end of the `if` line is required, and the line below must be
> indented. That’s how Python defines blocks of code.

---

### Adding `else`

Sometimes you want your program to do one thing **if the condition is true**,
and something else **if it’s false**. That’s what `else` is for:

```python
password = "hunter2"

if password == "hunter2":
    print("Access granted.")
else:
    print("Wrong password.")
```

If the condition fails, Python runs the `else` block instead.

---

### Using `elif` for Multiple Choices

If you want to check more than one condition in a row, use `elif` (short for
“else if”):

```python
score = 72

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("Try again")
```

Python checks each condition in order. As soon as one is true, it runs that
block and skips the rest.

---

### Nesting Conditionals

You can place an `if` statement inside another `if` to check multiple layers of
logic:

```python
age = 17
has_license = True

if age >= 16:
    if has_license:
        print("You can drive!")
    else:
        print("You need a license.")
else:
    print("You're too young to drive.")
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> While nested `if` statements are powerful, they can get messy. We'll explore
> cleaner alternatives using `and`, `or`, and functions in later chapters.

---

### Indentation Matters

Every block of code that follows `if`, `elif`, or `else` must be indented using
the **same number of spaces**. Python won’t run your program if indentation is
inconsistent.

```python
# Correct
if True:
    print("Works!")

# Incorrect
if True:
print("Will cause an IndentationError!")
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user to enter a number.
2. Prints whether the number is:

   * Positive
   * Negative
   * Or zero

Use `input()` and `if`/`elif`/`else` to handle each case.

In the next section, you’ll learn how Python treats different values as true or
false — even when they’re not technically booleans.
