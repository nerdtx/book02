## Section 2: Modifying Lists

One of the most powerful things about Python lists is that they are **mutable**,
meaning you can change them after they are created. You can add new items,
update existing ones, or remove things you don’t need.

---

### Changing Items by Index

You can reassign an element in a list by targeting its index:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

This changes the second item (`banana`) to `blueberry`.

---

### Adding Items

Python gives you several ways to add items to a list:

* **Append to the end**:

```python
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date']
```

* **Insert at a specific position**:

```python
fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'kiwi', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date']
```

---

### Removing Items

You can remove items by value or by position:

* **Remove by value** (removes the first match):

```python
fruits.remove("blueberry")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'kiwi', 'cherry', 'date']
```

* **Remove by index** with `.pop()`:

```python
fruits.pop(2)
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'kiwi', 'date']
```

* **Delete with `del`**:

```python
del fruits[0]
print(fruits)  # ['kiwi', 'date']
```

* **Clear the entire list**:

```python
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # []
```

---

### Checking for Membership

You can check whether a value exists in a list with the `in` keyword:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Banana is here!")
```

---

### Why This Matters

Being able to modify lists means you can treat them as **dynamic collections**:

* Add items as they come in (like new orders in a system)
* Update existing values (like changing a user’s status)
* Remove items when they’re no longer needed

This flexibility is what makes lists a cornerstone of Python programming.

### Practice Challenge

1. Start with an empty list called `tasks`.
2. Ask the user to enter three tasks, adding each one to the list.
3. Print the final list of tasks.
4. Then ask the user which task to remove, and remove it from the list.
5. Print the updated list.
