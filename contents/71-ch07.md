# Chapter 7: Databases

## Section 1: What Is a Database?

As programs grow, they need a reliable way to **store and organize
information**. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries work well for small amounts of
data while the program is running, but once it ends, that information
disappears. A **database** provides a permanent, structured place to keep data
so you can use it later.

### Flat Files vs Databases

A simple way to store information is in a **flat file**, such as a text file or
CSV (comma-separated values). For example:

```
name,age,grade
Ada,17,A
Grace,16,B
Linus,18,A
```

Flat files are easy to make, but they have limits:

* They can get messy with large amounts of data.
* Searching is slow — you have to read the entire file.
* Updating data safely can be difficult.

Databases solve these problems by providing tools to **store, organize, query,
and update** information efficiently.

### What Is a Relational Database?

A **relational database** organizes data into **tables**, similar to
spreadsheets.

* Each table has **columns** (fields) that define the type of data.
* Each row in the table is a **record** (or entry).
* Tables can be connected to each other through **relationships**.

For example, in a school database you might have:

**Students Table**

| id | name  | age | grade |
| -- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| 1  | Ada   | 17  | A     |
| 2  | Grace | 16  | B     |
| 3  | Linus | 18  | A     |

Here:

* `id` is a unique identifier (called a **primary key**)
* Each row is one student
* Columns store the student’s attributes (name, age, grade)

### Why Use Databases?

Databases give your programs the ability to:

* Store large amounts of data safely
* Search and filter data quickly
* Update and delete records with precision
* Enforce rules, like making sure IDs are unique
* Connect related information across multiple tables

That’s why almost every modern web application — from social media sites to
online stores — is backed by a database.

### SQL: The Language of Databases

To interact with relational databases, we use a language called **SQL**
(Structured Query Language). With SQL, you can:

* Create tables
* Insert new data
* Query existing data
* Update or delete records

You’ll start learning SQL commands in the next section.

### Practice Challenge

1. Write down three examples of databases you interact with in daily life (hint:
   think about apps or websites you use).
2. Imagine designing a database for a library. List three pieces of information
   you would store about each book.
3. Which would be better for a growing library system: a flat file or a
   relational database? Why?
