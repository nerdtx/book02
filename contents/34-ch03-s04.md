## Section 4: While Loops

Sometimes, your program needs to repeat something until a condition changes —
like asking a user to enter a valid password, or waiting for a correct answer.

Python gives you a powerful tool for this: the **`while` loop**.

---

### Basic `while` Loop

A `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as a condition is true**.

```python
count = 0

while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count = count + 1
```

Output:

```
Counting: 0
Counting: 1
Counting: 2
```

Once `count` reaches 3, the condition `count < 3` becomes false and the loop
stops.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always make sure the condition will eventually become false — otherwise, your
> loop will run forever!

---

### Infinite Loops

This is an **infinite loop**, and it will never stop on its own:

```python
while True:
    print("Looping forever!")
```

You can stop an infinite loop by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

You’ll use infinite loops when:

* You want to wait for valid input
* You break out manually (see next)

---

### Breaking Out of a Loop

Use `break` to **exit a loop early**, even if the condition is still true:

```python
while True:
    word = input("Type 'stop' to exit: ")
    if word == "stop":
        break
```

This loop keeps running until the user types `"stop"` — then `break` exits the
loop.

---

### Skipping with `continue`

Use `continue` to **skip the rest of the current loop** and move to the next
iteration:

```python
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue  # skip printing 2
    print(num)
```

Output:

```
0
1
3
4
```

---

### Example: Password Retry

```python
correct_password = "open123"
attempts = 0

while attempts < 3:
    guess = input("Enter password: ")
    if guess == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong password.")
        attempts += 1

if attempts == 3:
    print("Too many attempts. Account locked.")
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a Python script that:

1. Asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 10
2. Repeats until the user enters a valid number
3. When valid, prints `"Thanks!"`

Use a `while` loop and `break` to keep asking until the user gets it right.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to use `for` loops to repeat tasks a set
number of times — great for menus, lists, and counting with precision.
