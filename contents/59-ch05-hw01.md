## Homework Assignment: Managing a Classroom with Lists and Tuples

### Objective

Practice creating, modifying, iterating, slicing, and applying lists and tuples
to organize and analyze real-world data.

---

### Part 1: Lists in Action

1. Create a list of 5 favorite movies.
2. Print the entire list.
3. Print only the first and last movie using indexes.
4. Add two new movies to the end of the list.
5. Remove one movie from the list by name.
6. Print the updated list.

---

### Part 2: Working with Loops

1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Use a `for` loop to print only the even numbers.
3. Use `enumerate()` to print each number with its index.

---

### Part 3: Slicing and Copying

1. Use slicing to grab the first 5 numbers from your list in Part 2.
2. Create another sublist containing every third number.
3. Make a full copy of the list and reverse it with slicing.
4. Print all results.

---

### Part 4: Tuples

1. Create a tuple representing your birthday `(month, day, year)`.
2. Unpack it into three variables and print each one.
3. Write a function called `min_max(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers and
   returns a tuple `(minimum, maximum)`.
4. Test it with your list of numbers from Part 2.

---

### Part 5: Combined Challenge – Student Scores

1. Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student’s name and
   score, e.g. `[("Ada", 95), ("Grace", 87), ("Linus", 78)]`.
2. Loop through the list and print each student’s name and score.
3. Write a function `highest_score(students)` that returns the `(name, score)`
   of the highest-scoring student.
4. Print the result.

---

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)

* Extend Part 5 so that the program prints all students who passed (score ≥ 70)
  in one list, and all who failed in another list.
* Use slicing, loops, and conditionals where appropriate.

---

### Submission Requirements

* A single Python file named `chapter5_homework.py` containing all parts.
* Make sure to include comments explaining each part of your code.
