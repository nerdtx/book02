## Section 6: Selecting Fields and Aggregating Data

So far, you’ve used `SELECT *` to grab every column and every row from a table.
That’s useful for testing, but in real applications you almost always want
*just part of the data*. SQL gives you tools to choose which *columns*,
**projections**, and which *rows*, **predicates**, you want — and to summarize
information with aggregation.

---

### Projections: Selecting Specific Columns

In database terms, a **projection** means choosing which columns you want to
see.

Example:

```sql
SELECT name, grade FROM students;
```

Instead of returning the whole table, this shows only the student names and
grades.

Output:

| name  | grade |
| ----- | ----- |
| Ada   | A     |
| Grace | B     |
| Linus | A     |

This is more efficient and easier to read than `SELECT *` and can make a great
deal of difference on the performance of a query on a table with millions of
rows.

---

### Predicates: Filtering Rows with Conditions

A **predicate** is a condition used in a `WHERE` clause to filter rows.

Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students
WHERE age > 16;
```

This query projects only the `name` and `age` columns *and* applies a
predicate to return only students older than 16.

Output:

| name  | age |
| ----- | --- |
| Ada   | 17  |
| Linus | 18  |

---

### Aggregating Data

Sometimes you want to *summarize* data instead of listing every row. SQL has
built-in functions for this, called **aggregate functions**:

* `COUNT()` — how many rows
* `AVG()` — average value
* `MIN()` — smallest value
* `MAX()` — largest value
* `SUM()` — total of all values

Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
```

This counts how many rows are in the `students` table.

```sql
SELECT avg(age) FROM students;
```

This gives the average student age.

---

### Grouping Data with `GROUP BY`

You can combine projections, predicates, and aggregates to analyze groups of
rows.

Example:

```sql
SELECT grade, COUNT(*) FROM students
GROUP BY grade;
```

This query groups students by grade and counts how many are in each group.

Output:

| grade | COUNT(*) |
| ----- | -------- |
| A     | 2        |
| B     | 1        |

---

### Putting It All Together

Projections (columns), predicates (filters), and aggregates (summaries) often
work together:

```sql
SELECT grade, AVG(age) FROM students
WHERE age > 16
GROUP BY grade;
```

* **Projection**: grade and average age
* **Predicate**: only students older than 16
* **Aggregate**: average age per grade

---

### Why This Matters

With projections, predicates, and aggregates, you can:

* Pull just the columns you need
* Filter results to the exact rows you want
* Summarize data for reports and analysis

This is what turns SQL from a storage system into a
*powerful tool for understanding information*.

### Practice Challenge

1. Select only the `name` and `grade` columns from the `students` table.
2. Count how many students are in the table.
3. Find the average age of all students.
4. Group students by grade and count how many are in each grade.
5. Select only students older than 16 and group them by grade, counting how many
   are in each group.
