## Section 4: Dictionaries

While lists are great for ordered collections of items, **dictionaries** are
better when you want to store data in **key-value pairs**. Think of a dictionary
like a real-life glossary: each key (the word) has an associated value (the
definition).

---

### Creating a Dictionary

Use curly braces `{}` to define a dictionary:

```python
user = {
    "username": "ada95",
    "email": "ada@example.com",
    "age": 28
}
```

Each item has a **key** and a **value**, separated by a colon.  Thing of the key
as the name of the bucket and the value as the contents of that bucket; and the
dictionary holds all the buckets... it's a lame analogy.

---

### Accessing and Updating Values

You access a value using its key:

```python
print(user["username"])  # ada95
```

You can also update values or add new keys:

```python
user["age"] = 29
user["is_active"] = True
```

---

### Checking for Keys

You can use `in` to check if a key exists:

```python
if "email" in user:
    print("Email:", user["email"])
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you try to access a key that doesn't exist, Python will raise a `KeyError`.
> You can avoid this by using `.get()`:

```python
print(user.get("phone", "No phone number on file"))
```

To be more explicit, `somedict.get(key, default_if_not_there)`  If you don't
specify the default, `None` is returned from a get that fails.

---

### Removing Items

There are two options for removing an item from a dictionary: pop and del.

```python
user.pop("age")         # Removes the key "age"
del user["username"]    # Also removes the key "username"
```

Although not exactly the same, the result in the contents of the dictionary is
equivalent.  We will discuss `del` in later chapters.

---

### Looping Through Dictionaries

You can loop through keys, values, or both:

```python
for key in user:
    print(key, "->", user[key])
```

```python
for key, value in user.items():
    print(key, "->", value)
```

---

### Practice Challenge

Write a script that:

1. Creates a dictionary representing a book with keys for `title`, `author`, and
   `year`
2. Adds a `genre` key after creation
3. Updates the `year` value
4. Prints all key-value pairs using a loop

---

Next, you’ll learn how to combine lists and dictionaries together to manage
more complex sets of data — like user databases, inventory systems, or class
rosters.
